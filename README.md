This repository demonstrates a common C++ error involving the use of pointers and dynamically sized containers like `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains code that exhibits undefined behavior due to invalid memory access. The `bugSolution.cpp` file offers a corrected version illustrating safe pointer usage and memory management with vectors.  The issue is related to how pointers interact with vectors when the vector's internal storage is reallocated.
